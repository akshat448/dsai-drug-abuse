CRAVING_TEMPLATE = """Cravings are a normal part of recovery, and what you're experiencing is valid. Here are some strategies that have helped others:

**Immediate coping:**
• Grounding: Notice 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste
• Distraction: Call someone, go for a walk, engage in a hobby
• Delay: Wait 15-20 minutes - cravings often pass

**Longer-term support:**
• Share with your support network or sponsor
• Attend a meeting (AA, NA, SMART Recovery)
• Review your reasons for recovery

**Professional help:**
• SAMHSA Helpline: 1-800-662-4357
